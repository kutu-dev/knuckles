# Knuckles
> A [OpenSubsonic](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/) API wrapper for Python 3.11.0+.

## Compatiblity
Knuckles **only** works with servers compatible with the REST API version 1.4.0 onwards (Subsonic 4.2+).
It follows strictly the [OpenSubsonic API Spec](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/docs/opensubsonic-api/), it being fully retro-compatible with the original [Subsonic API](https://subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp).
