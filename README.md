# Knuckles
> A [Subsonic](https://subsonic.org/pages/index.jsp)/[OpenSubsonic](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/) API wrapper for Python.

## Compatibility and scope
Knuckles **only** works with music servers compatible with the REST API version 1.4.0 (Subsonic 4.2). It follows strictly the [OpenSubsonic API Spec](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/docs/opensubsonic-api/) **without** implementing any endpoint related to video media and the legacy non-ID3 file-based system.
